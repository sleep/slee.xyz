title: "Idea: Stage-Agnostic Constraint Logic (Meta) Programming"

The following is a rough outline of a hypothetical programming environment. Note I only half know what I'm talking about.

- **Embrace staging:** Have some way of modeling and structuring multi-stage computation.
- **Relational:**: Everything will revolve around a constraint logic system.


- Define a deterministic subset of the system
-
